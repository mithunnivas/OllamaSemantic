Simple C# API project to implement RAG, Ollama, Text File Upload and interacting with the Agent related to the text uploaded.

The commented portion of the code can be used to check if the code is able to communicate with the locall llm to minize the connection troubleshooting with AI agent.
This code is based on the https://davek.dev/beginners-guide-to-semantic-kernel-with-dapper-postgresql-and-pgvector-in-c.
Credits to the dev for the above code.
I have modified it to accommodate Ollama.
